Independent Study on the topic of Computer Graphics

The first project is an interactive Rubik's Cube made in C++ and OpenGL. 
The user can input how many turns they would like the cube to be shuffleed for when they first stast the program and can also save a current cube layout and load it back in at a later time.
To make rotations, the user clicks and holds down on one of the 4 sides of a pane (not the face of the pane) and moves the mouse in the direction they would like to rotate.
To view different angles of the cube, the user can click and drage the mouse anywhere in the window outside of the cube.
When the user solves the cube, the program will notify the user via the terminal.
